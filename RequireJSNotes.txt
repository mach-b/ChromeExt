RequireJS

"RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader.
It is optimized for in-browser use,
but it can be used in other JavaScript environments,
like Rhino and Node.
Using a modular script loader like RequireJS
will improve the speed and quality of your code."


COMPATABLE WITH:
...
Chrome 3+
Firefox 2+
...

Get from: http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html
There is a minified and commented version,
and a plugins etc.

ADD TO THE PROJECT:
Assuming all JavaScript files in a "scripts" directory,
add require.js to scripts directory.

e.g.
projectDir/
    project.html
    scripts/
        main.js
        require.js
        somethingelse.js
        helper/
            util.js

RequireJS recommends keeping all inline code out of the HTML.
Only reference require.js with a require call to load the script.
e.g.
<script data-main="scripts/main" src="scripts/require.js"></script>


USE:
"Inside of main.js you can use require() to load any scripts
you need to run.  This ensures a single entry point, since the
data-main  script you specify is loaded asynchronously.""

require(["helper/util"], function(util) {
    //This function is called when scripts/helper/util.js is loaded.
    //If util.js calls define(), then this function is not fired until
    //util's dependencies have loaded, and the util argument will hold
    //the module value for "helper/util".
});

That will load the helper/util.js script. To get full advantage of RequireJS, see the API docs to learn more about defining and using modules.
